## Work in progress: This is not finished yet

<div id="graph">
<img src="images/nvulnerabilities.png" alt="Proportion of devices affected by root vulnerabilities"/>
<p>Devices running vulnerable versions of Android</p>
</div>

## Why?

We are collating all the root equivalent vulnerabilities in Android and storing all the information about them in a [machine reable format (json)](spec) with references for each fact.
This allows for analysis of what proportion of Android devices are vulnerable to different vulerabilities by using the [Device Analyzer](https://deviceanalyzer.cl.cam.ac.uk/) data.
It should also allow us to compare different manufacturers and network operators in terms of the time it takes them to supply updates to customers.
This work is being coordinated by [Daniel Thomas](submitters/drt24).

## [List of vulnerabilities](all)
* [by manufacturer](by/manufacturer)
* [by year](by/year)
* [by Android version](by/version)
* [by submitter](by/submitter)
