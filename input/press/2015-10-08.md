## Manufacturers fail to provide security updates

A new study by researchers at the University of
Cambridge has shown that 87% of Android devices are vulnerable to attack
by malicious apps and messages. Manufacturers are to blame, because most
do not provide regular security updates. Some manufacturers are much
better than others however, and the study shows that devices built by LG
and Motorola, as well as those devices shipped under the Google Nexus
brand are much better than most. Users, corporate buyers and regulators
can find further details on manufacturer performance at <http://androidvulnerabilities.org/>

The study uses data collected by the team's [Device Analyzer](http://deviceanalyzer.cl.cam.ac.uk/) app, which
is [available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.ac.cam.deviceanalyzer) from the Google Play Store. "The app collects data from volunteers
around the globe and provides us with the statistical data we need" said
Daniel Thomas, lead author of the study, "we have used data from over
20,000 devices to support our results, but we're keen to recruit more
contributors." The [full results](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~drt24/papers/spsm-scoring.pdf) of the study will be presented on Monday 12th October
at the Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones and Mobile Devices.


"The security community has been worried about the lack of security
updates for Android devices for some time," said Dr Rice, "Our hope is
that by quantifying the problem we can help people when choosing a
phone and that this in turn will provide an incentive for
manufacturers and operators to deliver updates."

"Google has done a good job at mitigating many of the risks," said Dr
Beresford "and we recommend users only install apps from Google's Play
Store since it performs additional safety checks on apps. Unfortunately
Google can only do so much, and recent Android security problems have
shown that this is not enough to protect users. Phones require updates
from manufacturers, and the majority of devices aren't getting them."
